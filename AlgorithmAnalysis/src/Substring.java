public class Substring {
    /*
    The solution to this problem is very similar to the longest common subsequence.
    We will use a 2D array to store the length of the substrings.
    A nested for loop will parse through each character of both strings, marking where matching characters occur
    as well as storing the length of the substring.
    It will return a substring of one of the input texts based on the end location and the length
